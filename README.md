![The game in action](http://i.imgur.com/euiIk1s.gif)

Inspired by [Swarm Simulator](https://swarmsim.github.io/#/) I decided to fool around a bit in Python and attempt
to create the bare basics for a [Incremental Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) that you play
in your windows command line...

This is just a toy project and nothing serious ;-)

Requirements
------------
* [Python](http://python.org/download/releases/) >= 3.4
